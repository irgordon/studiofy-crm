**The Studio Operating System for WordPress.**

Studiofy CRM "Everest" represents a complete architectural rewrite, prioritizing performance, data sovereignty, and workflow automation.

## 🏔️ The Everest Architecture

* **Hybrid Database:** Utilizes Custom Tables for high-volume Client data and Custom Post Types for Workflow items (Projects, Contracts), ensuring maximum compatibility with the WordPress ecosystem.
* **Zero-Bloat Integration:** Replaces 50MB of external libraries with lightweight, native HTTP API wrappers for Square and Google.
* **Modular Logic:** Features are isolated into modules (Kanban, Forms, Contracts), allowing for granular maintenance and upgrades.

## 🚀 Key Modules

### 1. Production Kanban
Drag-and-drop project management with visual cues for stalled projects and throughput reporting.

### 2. Smart Contracts
A block-based contract builder that combines locked legal templates with dynamic project data and HTML5 e-signatures.

### 3. Financial Engine
Direct integration with Square Payments API to generate, track, and link invoices to specific projects.

### 4. Client Hub
A unified view aggregating all client interactions, bookings, and galleries.
