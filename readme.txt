A comprehensive business suite for photographers. Manage clients, contracts, invoices, and high-speed proofing galleries with native Elementor integration.

== Description ==

**Studiofy CRM** is the ultimate operating system for professional photographers. Stop paying monthly fees for external SaaS platforms—Studiofy brings your entire business workflow directly into your WordPress dashboard.

Designed with a **"Performance & Privacy First"** architecture, Studiofy v2.2+ features a rewritten Gallery engine optimized for speed, ensuring your client proofing pages load instantly even with hundreds of images.

### 🎨 Native Elementor Integration
We believe in design freedom. Studiofy adds custom **Widgets** to Elementor, allowing you to build your Client Portal exactly how you want it.

* **Lead Capture Forms:** Drag-and-drop forms that auto-populate your CRM database.
* **Booking Calendar:** Real-time session scheduling with availability checks.
* **Proofing Galleries:** Beautiful, responsive, and secure image grids.

### 🚀 Core Modules

* **Customer Management:** Securely store client details with AES-256 encryption.
* **Project Kanban:** Visual workflow management (To Do / In Progress / Done) combined with a detailed list view.
* **Invoicing:** Square API integration (Sandbox/Production support) with tax calculations and dynamic line items.
* **Digital Contracts:** eSignature capture and PDF generation. Now supports Elementor for template design.
* **File Management:** A dedicated "Windows Explorer" style interface for organizing client shoots. Supports RAW files via Chunked Uploads.

### ⚡ High-Speed Performance
The latest updates introduce advanced optimization techniques:
* **DOM Batching:** Zero-lag rendering for large gallery grids.
* **Chunked Uploads:** Stream large files in 2MB chunks to bypass server limits.
* **Lazy Loading:** Native browser optimization for image delivery.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload the `studiofy-crm` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  **Requirement:** This plugin requires **Elementor** to display frontend widgets. A notice with an install link will appear if it is missing.
4.  Navigate to **Studiofy CRM > Settings** to configure your Business Branding, Logo, and Square API keys.
5.  (Optional) Use the "Demo Data" section in Settings to import sample content for testing.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this replace WooCommerce? =
Studiofy is designed for service-based photography businesses (Invoices, Contracts, Bookings). It does not replace WooCommerce for selling physical products, but handles the service workflow much better.

= Is my client data secure? =
Yes. We use OpenSSL AES-256-CBC encryption for sensitive fields (Phone Numbers, Addresses) in the database to ensure privacy at rest.

= Can I upload RAW files? =
Yes! The Gallery module supports RAW file uploads (.CR2, .NEF, .ARW) for storage and delivery, in addition to standard JPG/PNG/GIFs.
